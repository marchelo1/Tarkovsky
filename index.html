          <h3>Andrei Tarkovsky Films</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond the anarchies, Tarkovsky denounced the apparent order and the
            paradoxes of an insensible world. Spiritual, sensory and rebellious,
            this poet, for once not so cursed, reveals secret impostures,
            explores serene enjoyments, a world of rekindled dreams! <br />

          <h3>The World According To Tarkovsky</h3>
          <p>
            At times it can appear as if Andrei Tarkovsky movies are made only
            for Andrei Tarkovsky. But the director’s willingness to invite
            viewers to render their own interpretations of the material is a
            testament to his generosity as a filmmaker. The Solaris director
            once said, “Show the audience life, and they’ll find within
            themselves the means to assess and appreciate it.” Ultimately it is
            the investigations of life within Andrei Tarkovsky films that lead
            to spellbinding storytelling.

            <h3>About Andrei Tarkovsky</h3>
            <p>
              Andrei Tarkovsky is almost certainly the most famous Russian
              filmmaker since Eisenstein. His visionary approach to cinematic
              time and space, as well as his commitment to cinema as poetry,
              mark his oeuvre as one of the defining moments in the development
              of the modern art film. Although he never tackled politics
              directly, the metaphysical preoccupations of films such as Andrei
              Rublev (1966), Mirror (1974) and Stalker (1979) provoked ongoing
              hostility from the Soviet authorities.
